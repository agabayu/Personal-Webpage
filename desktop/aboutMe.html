                <p>Hello, my name is Angela You, a rising college freshman based in NYC with a deep interest in computer science, user experience design, and realistic art. I’ve spent the past few years exploring tech through programs like Girls Who Code, Kode With Klossy, and Cornell Catalyst, where I built projects ranging from AI chatbots to rescue robots. Whether I’m drawing, coding, or designing, I’m always thinking about how to create personalized, intuitive experiences that make a real impact.</p>
                <p>I want to use technology to create tools that are accessible, beautiful, and empowering, especially for people who don’t usually see themselves represented in tech. My goal is to blend creativity and logic to build solutions that matter.</p>
